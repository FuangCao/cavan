配置gradle有时会用一些路径相关的环境变量，常用的几个定义如下:
projectDir
	The directory containing the project build file.

rootDir
	The root directory of this project. The root directory is the project directory of the root project.

buildDir
	The build directory of this project. The build directory is the directory which all artifacts are generated into. The default value for the build directory is projectDir/build
